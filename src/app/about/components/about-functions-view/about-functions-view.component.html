    <b>Main position</b> is the position your player is effectively playing on the field. So if a player
    has roles DC and DL, but you mostly play him as DL, set that to his main position. It will then display
    the white skills correctly without involving the ones from the other positions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Effective %</b> is the normalized strength considering only white skills of his main position. These
    effective white skills are the white ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>White skill %</b> is the normalized strength considering all white skills. This can differ as soon as 
    a player has more than 1 role. These additional skills are displayed slightly gray.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Top Eleven %</b> is the strength displayed in Top Eleven itself, where all skills are considered.
